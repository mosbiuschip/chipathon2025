# Information about the GF180 Technology (gf180mcuD) and Design Examples

## Documentation
- [Open PDK Documentation](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [Definition of the Process Variant](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/gf180mcu/Makefile.in)

## Process Variant
From [Definition of the Process Variant](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/gf180mcu/Makefile.in): 
> GF180MCU uses the same base process as
> other GF180 processes.  However, instead of a thin oxide gate, the base
> oxide is a thick oxide, and the thick oxide mask defines a thicker oxide.
> The process DRC rules then follow the rule sets for thick oxide devices,
> so the minimum length transistor is 280nm, making this much more like a
> 0.28um process than a 0.18um process.

- [Overview of MOS Devices](./devices.md)
- [Metal Layer Stack](metal_stack.md) 
   - Five layers of metal
   - Top metal (5) is 1.1 $\mu m$ thick
- MIM capacitor 
   - Between top metal (5) and the metal below (4)
   - MIM capacitor density is 2 fF per $\mu m^2$
- High sheet-resistivity Wide Nwell (unsalicided) resistor (1K $\Omega$ /square)
